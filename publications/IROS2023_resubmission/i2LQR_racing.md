This paper is the follow-up work of our CDC2023 paper. It applies i2LQR on car racing in a dynamic and random environment, which is benchmarked with LMPC(Both LMPC itself and LMPC with slackness). The demos above can provide you a rough understanding of our work.

The paper now is under its final revision and the preprint version will be released soon. More details about this work will be available after that!
