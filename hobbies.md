I'm a member of Xi'an Jiaotong University Piano Salon, and I've be playing piano for years since I was a child! I love it! Here are some photos of me from the concerts we held.

A video of me playing Beethoven's *Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Op. 13, "Path√©tique": II. Adagio cantabile* can be found [here](https://b23.tv/aqQGNgc)

Here are some photos from our class concert. I started learning to sing when I was in my last year of high school, and I've kept taking singing classes during my undergraduate time. I really love it!

I'm also a composing lover! Creating music is cool for me! Here is a piece of music score of a trio recomposed by me from *A Thousand Years*, inspired by the video [here](https://b23.tv/8kYiIip). If you also happen to love music, the full score is [here](https://yihanli126.github.io/file/A_Thousand_Years.pdf) free for you. You are always welcome to play it!
