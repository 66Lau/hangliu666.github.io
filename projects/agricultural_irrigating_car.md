This project is for 2022 China Robot Competition. Our team is in the water-saving irrigation track of the competition, and we developed an intelligent car to excute the task.

<br>

The kernal logic control of the project is based on ROS on raspberry pi. We used a lidar with SLAM for perception and base stations for localization calibrating. The intelligent car can detect and locate the target flowerpot, move towards it, water the plant according to the provided drought information and then go on for next target.

I was responsible for the motion control and the localization of the car in the project, and a video of the robust test for the direction control and localization can be found [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/pBVSSQrjiYw?si=kgx5rFtwm55Knz1R)
